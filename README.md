## Shortcuts:

* **Ctrl+R** to refresh the list of installed apps.
* **Ctrl+G** to visit the Github page.
* **Ctrl+A** to view the "About" window.
* **Ctrl+Q** to quit the app.

## App limitations:

* It takes a few seconds to list all currently installed apps, due to the   Windows PowerShell subprocesses.
* You can only **uninstall** apps with this GUI, hence the name.
